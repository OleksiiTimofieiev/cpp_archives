- "this->" operator for havin an access to the var;

- srtuct Point {var, var, void shift(...);}
- declaration of the method: void shift(...);
- description of the method: void Point::shift{...};

- int & get <- a return int function;

- header file <- "*.hpp";

- constructor is a method to init a structure;
- in order to create a constructor we have to make a func (void) with a same name as a struct (seems to be the same identifier);
- x = (y = 0);
- constructors are being invoked automaticall during the var declaration;

- set as default:

constructor -> Point(double x = 0, double y = 0) -> with no params => will be set to 0;
	: x(x), y(y)
	{}
- segment () {} -> vars of segment will be set to 0;
- explicit -> to forbid;

- destructor <- to delete a struct;
- destructor <-> ~asdf() {delete [] data}
- destructor will be executed after the end of the function block;
