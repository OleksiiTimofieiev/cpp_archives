- inheritance is anmechanism whick allows to create child classes expanding the already available ones;

- no default constructor or destructor -> set them explicitly;
- constructor of the parent has to be set explicitly;

- first ot be called the destructor of the inheritance class and then the parent class;

- Pointers to the object of a class has to initialized through a parent class data type;

- relavent fields of the parent class can be copied from the parent class through pointers (it is possible because we have its address);

- we can`t use the private fields of the parent class if they has been declared as private;

- protected variables can be used only by the child of the class;
