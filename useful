boolean data type;

- overloading <-> can be used created with the same identifier, but with the different signature (params, return value, etc.);

- reference <-> keeps the address where the data allocated. To work with original -> not with a copy (int & var), can be used to return several values;

- const:

~ const int var <-> const of the var value;
~ int * const var <-> new memory for the pointer can not be allocated;
~ const int * const var <-> new memory for the pointer can not be allocated and the values can not be modified;

- constructor types:

~ init list;
~ default;
~ overloaded;

- static fields of the class <-> can be used as "id creator";

- static methods of the class <-> access the variables globally (for example, for initialization);

- nested / inner class <-> for the single use only;

- array of objects;

- inheritance:

? modifiers of inheritance;
